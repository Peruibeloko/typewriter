# Typewriter

I hate WordPress and the way it does things.

Its locked down on many levels, stores excessive data for simpler applications and has a really terrible customization engine. The main issue? Too many things in a single place.

Thats where this project comes in!

Store just the essential, ask for just the essential, plug whatever frontend suits your tastes. If it does GQL, it does typewritter!

Thats really how far WordPress drove me mad.
